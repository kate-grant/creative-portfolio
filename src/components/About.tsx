  `I am a poet and interdisciplinary artist from Brooklyn. My work explores the quiet geometries of a path shaped by city light and porous faÃ§ades. I hold a B.A. in Music,  channeling a subtle rhythm that hums beneath my prose and language shaped like melody.`,
  `My creative path moves between the written word, the visual, and the sonic, always chasing resonance over rules.`,
  `Whether sculpting stanzas, crafting visual experiences, or composing textures of sound, I seek moments that trace the intersections of technology, creativity, and the quiet architectures of memory.`,
  `Art, for me, is not a medium but a meeting place. My background in music taught me to listen deeply. Now, I build experiences that echo the environments that shape us.`,
